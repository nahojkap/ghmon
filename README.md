# ghmon

'_ghmon_' is a simple command line utility to monitor your open pull requests on Github.  It provides a simple UI to list the PRs that you have been requested to review, sorting them according to status, age and other criteria.

While it is still work in progress, it aims to provide a quick overview of pending review requests as well as a simple notification channel.

'_ghmon_' requires the GitHub CLI to be installed and authentication having been performed in order to work (see https://github.com/cli/cli).
